# UserApp

## Overview

UserApp is a simple project that demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using GraphQL. The primary objective of this project is to learn the fundamentals of GraphQL implementation and how to configure a project that utilizes this technology.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. Unlike REST, where each resource has a dedicated endpoint, GraphQL allows you to request exactly the data you need with a single query, improving efficiency and reducing the amount of data transferred over the network. It's a powerful tool for building APIs that are flexible, robust, and scalable.

### Key Features of GraphQL:
- **Strongly Typed Schema**: All queries and mutations are defined by a schema, providing a clear contract between client and server.
- **Single Endpoint**: Unlike RESTful APIs, GraphQL uses a single endpoint to access the data, making it more flexible.
- **Precise Data Fetching**: Clients can request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching.
- **Real-Time Updates**: With subscriptions, GraphQL supports real-time data updates.
